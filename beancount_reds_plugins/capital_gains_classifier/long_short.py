"""Rebooks capital gains accounts into separate short-term and long-term accounts based on length held
according to IRS, US.

Invoke it in your beancount source this way:
<key> : [<substring_to_replace>, <replacement_for_short-term>, <replacement_for_long-term>]

  where <key> is a regexp to match in a posting account.
  Note that <key> is a regexp while the remaining values are strings

Example:
plugin "long_short" "{
    'Income.*:Taxable:Capital-Gains:' : [':Capital-Gains', ':Capital-Gains:Short', ':Capital-Gains:Long']
    }"

Currently, only a single key in the dictionary is supported. Additional keys will be ignored

TODO:
    - support multiple pattern/replacement/replacement sets. Via regexp or via lists

# Long-term or short-term. If you hold investment property more than 1 year, any capital gain or loss is a
# long-term capital gain or loss. If you hold the property 1 year or less, any capital gain or loss is a
# short-term capital gain or loss.
#
# To determine how long you held the investment property, begin counting on the date after the day you
# acquired the property. The day you disposed of the property is part of your holding period.
#
# Example.
#
# If you bought investment property on February 5, 2008, and sold it on February 5, 2009, your holding period
# is not more than 1 year and you have a short-term capital gain or loss. If you sold it on February 6, 2009,
# your holding period is more than 1 year and you have a long-term capital gain or loss.
